# semantics

A short intro into the wonderful world of semantics.

What are semantics for a computer program? What are semantics for a human program? Where's/what's the silver lining that get's us to that wonderful Graal that is an artificial brain?

Clojure is used to underline the points and to have fun with this trully magnificent language.

## Usage

The guideline presentation slides are in the resources/ folder

To explore the human semantics just call:

```Clojure
(semantics.human/triple-translate "Q&A")
```

The rest of the namespaces were used to understand/hint-at axiomatic, operational and denotational semantics, denotational design and why clojure.spec is such a clever thing.
